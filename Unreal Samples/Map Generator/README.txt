This folder contains code that I am currently developing for use with Unreal Engine.
The code is a prototype of the map generator that I will use to build the dungeons of one of my games.

To demo the project, navigate to the debug folder and run the executable.
  # symbols represent a tile on a map that is filled by a room.
  _ symbols represent a tile on the map that is empty.
  S represents where the play will start.
  E represents the exit to dungeon.
